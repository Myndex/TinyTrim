# TinyTrim

A set of CSS generic classes for on-the-fly adjustment of elements without having to add a long style list every time you need to adjust an element like:

    style="lots-of-stuff: #ugh;"

This CSS sheet is mainly for use in development and early design stages, but can be useful for sites where you need a lot of flexibility for special pages.
