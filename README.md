# TinyTrim

A set of CSS generic classes for on-the-fly adjustment of elements without having to add a long style list every time you need to adjust an element like:

    style="lots-of-stuff: #ugh;"

This CSS sheet is mainly for use in development and early design stages, but can be useful for sites where you need a lot of flexibility for special pages.

## Classes

The class names are very terse. For instance, font-size is fs, and setting an element to font-size: 1.2em; is the class **.fs12** setting all margins to 0 is .m0 or setting the top margin to 12px is mt12p  etc.

There's a set of classes for standard HTML color names, plus a set for color and border-color using LuvLCh colors in 5 dgree increments as in Luv015 is Luv 15 degrees, which is red. And a set of colors specifically for background use, all of which are light enough for body text.

There's a brief usage guide in the non-minified version.
